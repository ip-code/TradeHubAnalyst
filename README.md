# TradeHubAnalyst

TradeHubAnalyst is a windows application [.exe] designed for trading between stations. It collects data for all of the items of Eve Online from file **invTypes.xls.bz2** downloaded from https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/latest/
and performs filtration based upon trading data downloaded from https://evemarketer.com/ API at https://api.evemarketer.com/ec/marketstat

Data for the filtered items is then downloaded from https://evemarketer.com/types and then calculated to find potential profitable trades between trade hubs.
